## Where We Left Off

Previously we created a single model, `Book`.

Then we created a second model `Author` and linked it to `Book`.

Now we are going to add a third model: `Loan`. Which is going to act as a link
between the `Author`s and `Book`s.

This `Loan` model will join together `Author` and `Book`.  Earlier, when we
were working with a `one-to-many` relationship `books` belonged to an `author`.

We know this is a two way street however: `Books` can have many `Authors` and
`Authors` can have many `Books`.  When we created a migration:

```ruby
class AddAuthorToBooks < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_reference :books, :author, index: true, foreign_key: true
  end
end
```

We added an `author` reference column to the `books` table which is able to
store a reference to an author of a particular book.

In order to make this a two way street we are going to need a `join table`.

## Join Tables

A `join table` is a special table which holds refrences two or more tables.

Let's see what this table might look like:

![has_many_through](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10408784/17598817/451a3662-5fca-11e6-8ad1-613d4e56970f.png)

<!-- Image from Rails Docs -->

In the above example the `appointments` table is the `join table`. You can see
it has both a `physician_id` column and a `patient_id` column.  Both of these
columns store refrences to their respective tables.

You can also see a column called `appointment_date`. You are allowed to add
other columns on to your `join table`, but do not necessarily have to.  In this
case it makes sense, in some cases it may not, use your judgement.

## Removing a Column

But wait! We forgot an important step! Yesterday we added an `author_id` column
to `books`. Let's remove that before we go any further and our API performs in
a way we don't expect.

We need to create a migration to remove that column, from the Rails Guides:

```markdown
If the migration name is of the form "AddXXXToYYY" or "RemoveXXXFromYYY" and is
followed by a list of column names and types then a migration containing the
appropriate add_column and remove_column statements will be created.
```

Knowing this we can construct a migration that removes this column for us:

```bash
rails g migration RemoveAuthorIdFromBooks author_id:integer
```

and this creates the following migration:

```ruby
class RemoveAuthorIdFromBooks < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    remove_column :books, :author_id, :integer
  end
end
```

Now let's run this migration with `rake db:migrate`.  Is there anything else
that I could be forgetting? That may cause errors later?

<!-- Remove author_id from book Serializer -->

## Making a Join Table

We're going to use the generators that Rails provides to generate a `loan` model
along with a `loan` migration that includes references to both `author` and
`book`.

```ruby
rails g scaffold loan author:references book:references date:datetime
```

Along with creating a `loan` model, controller, routes, and serializer, Rails
will create this migration:

```ruby
class CreateLoans < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :loans do |t|
      t.references :author, index: true, foreign_key: true
      t.references :book, index: true, foreign_key: true
      t.datetime :date

      t.timestamps null: false
    end
  end
end
```

So our `Loan` table now has the following columns: ID, author_id, book_id, Date.

Let's run our migration with `rake db:migrate`

Let's take a peek at our database and see how this table looks. Simply type:

```bash
rails db
```

If your prompt looks like this `rails-api-library-demo_development=#` type:

```bash
\d loans
```

You will be able to see all the columns contained in the `loan` table.

## Through: Associated Records

While we can see that in the `loan` model some some code was added for us:

```ruby
class Loan < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :author
  belongs_to :book
end
```

But we need to go into our models (`author`, `book`, and `loan`) and add some
more code to finish creating our associations.

Let's go ahead and add that code starting with the `book` model:

```ruby
# Book Model
class Book < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :authors, through: :loans
  has_many :loans
end
```

In our author model we will do something similar:

```ruby
# Author Model
class Author < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :books, through: :loans
  has_many :loans
end
```

Finally in our `loan` model we're going to update it to:

```ruby
class Loan < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :author, inverse_of: :loans
  belongs_to :book, inverse_of: :loans
end
```

What is `inverse_of` and why do we need it?

When you create a `bi-directional` (two way) association, ActiveRecord does not
necessarily know about that relationship.

*I say necessarily because in future versions of Rails this is/may be resolved*

Without `inverse_of` you can get some strange behavior like this:

```ruby
a = Author.first
b = a.books.first
a.first_name == b.author.first_name # => true
a.first_name = 'Lauren'
a.first_name == b.author.first_name # => false
```

Rails will store `a` and `b.author` in different places in memory, not knowing to
change one when you change the other. `inverse_of` informs Rails of the
relationship, so you don't have inconsistancies in your data.

*For more info on this please read the [Rails Guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html)*

## Adding Via ActiveRecord

First, let's open our Rails console with `rails console`

And Let's create some books and authors

```ruby
# books
book1 = Book.create([{ title: 'Less Funny Than Jason'}])
book2 = Book.create([{ title: 'How I Miss Meat!'}])
book3 = Book.create([{ title: 'Lauren is on fleek'}])
book4 = Book.create([{ title: 'I am a Robot: Beep Boop'}])

#authors
author1 = Author.create([{ given_name: 'Lauren', surname: 'Fazah'}])
author2 = Author.create([{ given_name: 'Jason', surname: 'Weeks'}])
author3 = Author.create([{ given_name: 'Antony', surname: 'Donovan'}])
```
Check `localhost:3000/books` and `localhost:3000/authors` to see if we have
created books and authors.

## Updating Serializers

Now that we can see some data it's time to update our serializers or these
relationships will not be as useful as they can.

Let's add the author attribute to our attributes list in our `book` serializer.

Our finished serializer should look like this:

```ruby
class BookSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id, :title, :authors
end
```

Let's do the same in our `author` serializer, it should look like this once,
we're done.

```ruby
class AuthorSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id, :surname, :given_name, :books
end
```
